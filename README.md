Download images from Xiaomi phone

Xiaomi allows can create an ftp server to transfer data from the phone.

Connecting to the server I can download the media of interest within a specific date range to my computer in the ~/Pictures/YEAR/DESTINATION\_PN
The information is then deleted from the phone.

Goal is to easily transfer imagees / media from various sources, eg whatsapp, DCIM, viber folders of the phone.
these need to be setup in the `config.py` file.

Use:

Command line tool: `python downloader.py`

GUI (needs kivy): `python app.py`
